# CSE216: Programming Abstractions (State University of New York, Korea, Fall 2024)

# Course overview

This course is  offered by the CS Department of SUNY Korea. In this course, we will learn
Intermediate-level programming concepts and paradigms, including functional programming, object-orientation, basics of type systems, memory management, program and data abstractions, parameter passing and modularity.

This repository is publicly accessible and hosts courseware that will be incrementally added along the semester.  We will adapt the courseware from the ones used at SUNY Korea and Stony Brook University in previous years.

# Definition of Force Majeure in Our Policies

Force majeure in our policies includes, but is not limited to,  
- documented illness or family emergencies.

Note: A documented hospital visit alone is not sufficient to justify force majeure. The doctor's note must clearly state the reason for the absence and the recommended period of absence.

# Attendance Policy

- Attendance will be checked irregularly.
- Arriving late will count as half attendance. "Late" is defined as arriving after the attendance check has been completed. After the attendance check, the TA/Instructor will mark any absences.
- Excuses are granted only in cases of force majeure. See the definition above for "force majeure."
- In the event of discrepancies between the signed attendance sheet and actual physical presence, names will be called. Students involved may be addressed privately.
- In accordance with Korean law, more than 20% absence will result in an automatic F grade.

# Grading Policy

- Grading will be conducted by both the TA and the Instructor.
- Factual errors in grades will be corrected.
- Non-factual grade disputes will not be considered.
- Plagiarism, including the use of AI-generated solutions for homework, will result in a grade of 0 and will be reported. Students involved may be addressed privately.
- Typewritten submissions are recommended; illegible handwriting may result in a grade of 0.

# Late Homework Policy

- Late homework will not be accepted. 
- Homeworks submitted after the deadline are only permissible in cases of force majeure. See above for the definition of "force majeure."
-  Once homework solutions have been released, no submissions will be accepted under any circumstances.

# Email Policy

- Please include **[CSE216]** in the subject line for all course-related email communication with the instructor.
- Use the instructor's SUNY Korea email address (see above) whenever possible.
- You can expect a reply within 72 hours. If you do not receive a response within this timeframe, kindly send a reminder.
- Emails without **[CSE216]** in the subject line may be missed.

# ChatGPT Policy

We adhere to policies similar to those outlined in [Stanford's Generative AI Policy Guidance](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/generative-ai-policy-guidance).

- In general, the use of or consultation with generative AI is treated similarly to receiving assistance from another person.
- Using generative AI tools like ChatGPT to substantially complete homework assignments is not permitted.
- Students should acknowledge any use of generative AI tools (beyond incidental use) and should default to disclosing such assistance when in doubt.

# Office Hours Policy

- The instructor and TA will be available during scheduled office hours.
- Availability outside of office hours is not guaranteed, and the instructor and TA may respectfully decline appointment requests beyond these times.
  
# Disability Support Services (DSS) Statement

If you have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact  One-Stop Service Center, Academic Building A201, (82) 32-626-1117. They will determine with you what accommodations, if any, are necessary and appropriate. All information and documentation is confidential.

Students who require assistance during emergency evacuation are encouraged to discuss their needs with instructors and the One-Stop Service Center.




# Academic integrity

Each student must pursue his or her academic goals honestly and be personally accountable for all submitted work. Representing another person's work as your own is always wrong. Faculty members are required to report any suspected instances of academic dishonesty to the Academic Judiciary Committee or the Department of Academic Affairs, Campus Building A, Room 201, (032) 626-1121.



# Critical incident management

SUNY Korea expects students to respect the rights,
privileges, and property of other people. Faculty are required to report to the Department of Academic Affairs any disruptive behavior that interrupts their ability to teach, compromises the safety of the learning environment, or inhibits students' ability to learn.
