Special grading criteria:

- If your code does not compile, you will receive 0, even if you might argue your code is almost right. 

So, it is essential to check your code with Ocaml.

You will write an evaluator for simple arithmetic expressions.

Use the following type declaration that represents arithmetic expressions.
*)

    type exp =
      | Int of int
      | Add of exp * exp
      | Mul of exp * exp
      

(* Exercise 1 (Points = 30)

Encode the following arithmetic expressions as `exp`s:

1.  10 + 5
2.  (2 + 3) * 5
3.  3 * 0 * 3 * 5

*)

let expression1 = failwith "Not Implemented"

let expression2 = failwith "Not Implemented"

let expression3 = failwith "Not Implemented"


(* Exercise 2 (Points = 30)
Write the function eval: exp -> int, which reduces expressions to integer values:
*)

let rec eval (e:exp):int= failwith "Not Implemented"

(* Exercise 3 (Points = 30)
Write the function print : exp -> string , which returns a string representing `e`. The string should print arithmetic operators using infix notation and properly parenthesize expressions. Your solution may be similar to the following examples.

print (Add (Int 10, Int 5)) produces "(10 + 5)"
print (Mul (Add (Int 2, Int 3), Int 5)) produces "((2 + 3) * 5)"
print (Mul ((Mul (Int 3, Int 0)), Mul (Int 3, Int 5))) produces "((3 * 0) * (3 * 5))"
*)

let rec print (e:exp):string = failwith "Not Implemented"



(* This exercise is not diretly related to the previous ones. 
Exercise 4 (Points = 30)
Write the function is_sorted: int list -> bool to determine if the integers in an int lst are in sorted in ascending order.

*)

let rec is_sorted (lst:int list): bool = failwith "Not Implemented"
